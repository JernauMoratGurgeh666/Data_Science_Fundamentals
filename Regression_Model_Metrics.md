# Regression Model Metrics


Choosing the right metric to evaluate your regression model's performance is crucial, as it directly impacts your understanding of how well the model is performing and whether it meets your specific goals. The choice of metric should align with the problem you are trying to solve, the nature of the data, and the importance of different types of errors in your application. Here's a guide and checklist to help you decide which regression evaluation metric to use:

**1. Understand Your Problem:**

- **Define Your Goal:** Determine the primary goal of your regression analysis. Are you trying to make accurate predictions, interpret relationships between variables, or optimize a specific outcome?

- **Consider Stakeholder Needs:** Understand what metrics are important to stakeholders. Some may prioritize accuracy, while others may focus on interpretability or robustness.

**2. Know the Metrics:**

- Familiarize yourself with the common regression evaluation metrics. Here are some key ones:

   - **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination):** Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model. Higher R-squared indicates a better fit.
   
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It penalizes large errors more heavily.
   
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of MSE. It provides a measure of error in the same units as the dependent variable.
   
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It's less sensitive to outliers than MSE.
   
   - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** Measures the average percentage difference between predicted and actual values. Useful for relative error assessment.
   
   - **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):** Measures the goodness of fit of a statistical model, considering the trade-off between complexity and fit.

**3. Consider Your Data:**

- **Data Type:** The type of data you are working with may influence the choice of metric. For example, MAE and MAPE are suitable for non-negative data, while RMSE is suitable for continuous data.

- **Outliers:** If your data contains outliers, robust metrics like MAE or Huber loss might be more appropriate as they are less affected by extreme values.

**4. Set Performance Goals:**

- Establish performance benchmarks or goals based on your problem and domain knowledge. What level of accuracy or error is acceptable for your application?

**5. Interpretability vs. Accuracy:**

- Weigh the importance of model interpretability against predictive accuracy. Simpler models with lower R-squared might be preferred if interpretability is critical.

**6. Validation and Testing:**

- Use cross-validation or holdout validation to evaluate your model's performance on a separate test dataset. Compare multiple metrics to get a holistic view of performance.

**7. Domain Knowledge:**

- Consult with domain experts to gain insights into which errors are more critical in your specific application. This can guide your choice of metric.

**8. Checklist for Metric Selection:**

- Define your primary goal.
- Understand stakeholder priorities.
- Familiarize yourself with regression evaluation metrics.
- Consider data type and presence of outliers.
- Set performance benchmarks.
- Balance interpretability and accuracy.
- Use validation techniques.
- Seek domain expertise.

**9. Choose the Most Appropriate Metric:**

- Select the metric that aligns best with your goals, data type, and domain knowledge.

Remember that there is no one-size-fits-all metric for regression. It's often a trade-off between different metrics and their interpretation. Select the metric that best aligns with your specific objectives and the characteristics of your data, and be prepared to justify your choice based on the nature of your problem and stakeholder needs.


# Parametric Tests

Parametric and non-parametric tests are two broad categories of statistical tests used to analyze data and make inferences about populations. They differ in their underlying assumptions, the types of data they can handle, and the situations in which they are appropriate.

**Parametric Tests:**

1. **Assumptions:** Parametric tests make specific assumptions about the distribution of the data, typically assuming that it follows a known probability distribution, often the normal (Gaussian) distribution. They also assume that the data points are independent.

2. **Data Type:** Parametric tests are well-suited for continuous or interval data, where data points have a meaningful numerical interpretation. They are also suitable for normally distributed data.

3. **Examples:** Some common parametric tests include t-tests (for comparing means), ANOVA (analysis of variance), linear regression, and Pearson correlation.

4. **Strengths:** Parametric tests are often more powerful (sensitive) when the underlying assumptions are met. They can provide more precise estimates and are efficient for analyzing large datasets.

5. **Weaknesses:** They are sensitive to violations of assumptions. If data doesn't meet the assumptions (e.g., not normally distributed), the results can be misleading.

**Non-Parametric Tests:**

1. **Assumptions:** Non-parametric tests make fewer assumptions about the data's distribution. They don't assume that the data follows a specific probability distribution, which makes them more robust to deviations from normality and less sensitive to outliers.

2. **Data Type:** Non-parametric tests are suitable for a wide range of data types, including nominal, ordinal, interval, and even skewed or non-normally distributed data.

3. **Examples:** Some common non-parametric tests include the Mann-Whitney U test (a non-parametric alternative to the t-test), the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (for paired data), and the Kruskal-Wallis test (a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA).

4. **Strengths:** Non-parametric tests are robust and applicable to various types of data. They are less affected by outliers and deviations from normality.

5. **Weaknesses:** They are generally less powerful than parametric tests when the assumptions of parametric tests are met. They might not provide as precise estimates when the data follows a known distribution.

**When to Choose Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Tests:**

- **Parametric tests** are preferred when:
  - Data meets the assumptions of normality and independence.
  - The goal is to maximize statistical power (detecting true effects).
  - Precise estimates and confidence intervals are needed.

- **Non-parametric tests** are preferred when:
  - Data does not meet the assumptions of parametric tests.
  - Data is ordinal, nominal, or skewed.
  - The goal is to make robust inferences without relying on strong assumptions.

The choice between parametric and non-parametric tests depends on your data and the specific research question or analysis you are conducting. It's important to assess the assumptions of both types of tests and choose the one that is most appropriate for your data and objectives.
