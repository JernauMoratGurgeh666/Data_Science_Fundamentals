# Generalization

### For a University Student:

**Concept of Generalization:**

In mathematics or coding, the term "generalization" implies extending the applicability of a particular theorem, concept, or algorithm to a broader or more inclusive set of conditions. In essence, you create a more universally applicable rule from a specific case, without losing the original features that make the specific case work.

For example, you mentioned the Minkowski distance. This is a generalized metric in a metric space \( \mathbb{R}^n \). The Euclidean distance is a specific instance of the Minkowski distance when the parameter \( p = 2 \).

**Mathematically Speaking:**

- **Euclidean Distance** between points \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \) in a 2D space is \( \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2} \).

- **Minkowski Distance** is calculated as \( \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_{i} - y_{i}|^{p} \right)^{1/p} \).

When \( p = 2 \), the Minkowski distance formula reduces to the Euclidean distance formula.

**Relevant Paper:**  
For an advanced understanding, you can read the paper "A Survey of Minkowski Spacetime Geometry" which offers an in-depth view of the mathematical principles behind this distance measure.

### For a High-School Teenager:

**Concept of Generalization:**

When we talk about "generalization" in math or coding, it means taking something specific and making it more flexible and widely applicable. It's like when you learn a method to solve a certain type of math problem and then find out that the same method can also solve other, more complicated problems.

**Example with Minkowski Distance:**

You know the distance formula to find the distance between two points on a grid, right? That's called Euclidean distance. Minkowski distance is a fancy version of that formula, which can be adjusted to work in different situations.

- **Euclidean Distance**: It's like walking only along the grid lines to go from one point to another.
  
- **Minkowski Distance**: This one is more flexible. It can measure distance in a way that can be stretched or squished, like walking diagonally or taking larger steps.

### For a Kindergarten Child:

**Concept of Generalization:**

Imagine you have a special toy key that can only open a specific toy treasure chest. If we change this key a little bit so it can open many different treasure chests, we have made it "general." It means the key is now useful for more things!

**Example with Minkowski Distance:**

You know how you can count steps between two toys on the floor? That's like finding how far apart they are. There's a super special way of counting steps that even works if the floor was like a bumpy mountain or a wavy ocean. This special way of counting is what adults call "Minkowski Distance."

And guess what? The way you were counting steps before can also fit into this special way if you just think about it a little differently!
