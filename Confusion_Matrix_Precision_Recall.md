# Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions and the actual outcomes. The rows and columns in a confusion matrix represent different aspects of the model's performance:

**Rows:**

1. **True Positive (TP):** These are cases where the model predicted the positive class correctly, and the actual outcome is also positive. In other words, these are instances where the model correctly identified a positive occurrence.

2. **False Negative (FN):** These are cases where the model predicted the negative class, but the actual outcome is positive. In other words, these are instances where the model failed to identify a positive occurrence.

**Columns:**

1. **True Negative (TN):** These are cases where the model predicted the negative class correctly, and the actual outcome is also negative. In other words, these are instances where the model correctly identified a negative absence.

2. **False Positive (FP):** These are cases where the model predicted the positive class, but the actual outcome is negative. In other words, these are instances where the model incorrectly identified a positive occurrence.

Here's a visual representation of a confusion matrix:

```
             Actual Positive (1)   Actual Negative (0)
Predicted Positive (1)     TP                 FP
Predicted Negative (0)     FN                 TN
```

- **True Positive (TP):** Model predicted positive, and it's actually positive.
- **False Positive (FP):** Model predicted positive, but it's actually negative.
- **False Negative (FN):** Model predicted negative, but it's actually positive.
- **True Negative (TN):** Model predicted negative, and it's actually negative.

The confusion matrix allows you to assess the model's performance in terms of its ability to correctly classify instances into their respective classes and to identify common types of errors, such as false positives and false negatives. These values are crucial for calculating various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), specificity, and F1-score, among others, which provide a more comprehensive evaluation of a classification model's performance.


# Recall & Precision

**Recall** and **Precision** are two important evaluation metrics in the context of a confusion matrix and classification models. They focus on different aspects of model performance:

- **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):** Recall measures the ability of a model to correctly identify all relevant instances in a dataset. It answers the question: "Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly predict as positive?" Mathematically, it is defined as:

  Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

  - **High Recall:** When you need to ensure that you capture as many positive cases as possible, even at the cost of some false positives. High recall is important in situations where missing a positive case (false negative) is costly or has severe consequences.
  
  - **Example 1 (Medical Diagnosis):** In a medical test for a life-threatening disease, a high recall ensures that the test rarely misses detecting the disease, even if it means some false alarms.
  
  - **Example 2 (Spam Email Detection):** When classifying emails as spam or not, high recall ensures that legitimate emails are rarely misclassified as spam, even if it means a few spam emails reach the inbox.

- **Precision:** Precision measures the ability of a model to make positive predictions correctly. It answers the question: "Of all the instances predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?" Mathematically, it is defined as:

  Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

  - **High Precision:** When you want to ensure that the positive predictions made by the model are highly accurate and reliable, even if it means missing some positive cases. High precision is crucial when false positives are costly or problematic.
  
  - **Example 1 (Search Engine):** In a search engine, high precision ensures that most of the search results are relevant, even if some relevant results are missed.
  
  - **Example 2 (Credit Card Fraud Detection):** When detecting credit card fraud, high precision ensures that most flagged transactions are actual frauds, even if it means some fraudulent transactions are not detected.

In summary:

- **High Recall:** Prioritizes capturing all relevant instances, even at the cost of some false positives. Suitable when missing positives is costly or harmful.

- **High Precision:** Prioritizes the accuracy of positive predictions, even at the cost of missing some positives. Suitable when false positives are costly or undesirable.

The choice between high recall and high precision depends on the specific problem, its consequences, and the trade-off you are willing to make between correctly identifying positive instances and avoiding false positives. Often, you need to strike a balance between these two metrics based on the unique requirements of your application.
